<h3>Kindergarten</h3>
<p>During my kindergarten years, I don’t remember where I studied at.
Mainly because the kindergarten already moved to another places, and
the place are sold to another family.</p>

<h3>Primary school</h3>
<p>I studied at Methodist Girls Primary School Ipoh. During my years 
 there, there were two session, a morning (for fourth year until sixth 
 year students) and evening class (for first- and third-year student). 
 My class stayed the same for five year and during my last year, I moved 
one class back. I remember as a student, I wasn’t a diligent student but 
 I finished the school without any problem. After UPSR, I remember joining 
 a “senamrobik” competition, unfortunately, my class won the third place. </p>

<h3>Secondary School</h3>
<p>I continue my study at Methodist Girl’s Secondary School, this school is 
just next to the primary school. One unique feature about my school is that
there is no building separating the primary to the secondary school. We even
 share the canteen and main hall. Our class are in the same building but
 different floor. In my form 3, I joined the environmental club and joined them 
 going to Tempurung Cave. Form 3 also I joined a three-day camp, and it was my
 best memories, to bad I didn’t bring my phones and there weren’t many photos of us there</p>

<h3>University Year</h3>
<p>When I first come to UiTM Kedah, it was a totally new environment. I met so many 
 amazing new people. I also create so many memories. Being in university, I joined
Balloon Charity Run. I also join so many events. Not only that, I got the opportunity
 to be a facilitator for an event with outside school students. I was supposed to do another
 event during my fourth semester, however, pandemic hits us and we couldn’t continue doing it.</p>
